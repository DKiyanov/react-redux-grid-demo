## Contributing 

To begin creating an example, you can also simply copy an example folder and rename it.

Feel free to install other libraries (redux-thunk, redux-sagas, immutable, etc) to demonstrate any new functionality in your example folder.

## Website 

We used create-react-app to build the website adding Redux & React-Redux-Grid. 

```
create-react-app folderName 
cd folderName
npm i redux react-redux react-redux-grid redux-logger --save
```
